# Project II Instruction

## To run the Project_II_Run_Test.ipynb on the testset
1. Download the Pretrained_Model_Weight folder. 
2. Open Project_II_Run_Test.ipynb file.
3. You should change the input_path, output_path, submit_path and submitted_path in the code
    - The input_path in the code should be: the path of each raw subject folder.
    - The output_path in the code should be: the folder path that you use to save the registration and synthesis results which have not been resampled
    - The submit_path in the code should be: the folder path that saves the final registration results
    - The submitted_path in the code should be: the folder path that saves the final synthesis results
4. You should load the pretrained model for ADC and FA by changing the pretrained model path in the code
    - You should change the '/path_to_saved_FA_model' by the path of 'Pretrained_synthesis_model_FA.pth'
    - You should change the '/path_to_saved_ADC_model' by the path of 'Pretrained_synthesis_model_ADC.pth'
5. Run the cells in the code in order
